  | KickDoc is a new way to get involved in what National Film Board of Canada produce. Because our source of
  | inspiration has always been our people, canayan citizens have the power to choose what they will love to show
  | about our Canadian reality and culture to the World.
  | We allow this by changing the way we fund documentary productions. Our model consist of two main phases:
